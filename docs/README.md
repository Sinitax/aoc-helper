## Advent Of Code Helper

Helper scripts for the [coding advent calendar](https://adventofcode.com) that assist with scraping, submitting, preparing day directories.

Add this repository as a submodule to your aoc solutions repository, symlink the relevant configuration files and run `source enable` to enable the helper virtualenv from which scripts can be run via `aoc <cmd>`.
